# List Master
A .NET Core application built to try out Client-side Blazor with Web Assembly while making fun lists to pass the time away.

## Back Story

It all started with a conversation about the greatest musicals ever made. 

I worked as a software developer on an IT team nicknamed The Special Operations Squad (SOS). The conversation was part of our team's daily "geek water-cooler" talk where we do a casual deep dive into a random subject. We love to share our knowledge on multiple subjects and sometimes debate the greatest (or worst) items of a genre or category. 

Just for fun, we decided to make use of one side of our Dry-Erase Pillar where white-boarding and brainstorming occurs. Throughout the rest of the day, team members would submit their candidate for greatest musical by simply writing it on the board. Some items were cheered. Some items were vetoed. But in the end, we created an unordered list of what we considered were worthy candidates.

The next day, we had another water-cooler talk and were inspired to create another list - once more adding items as inspiration would hit us. This went on for months and served as a great way to have team bonding.

As I began to play around with Client-side Blazor, I thought it would be cool to try to make an application that served the same purpose as the "List of the Day". This repository is the result of that effort. :-)
